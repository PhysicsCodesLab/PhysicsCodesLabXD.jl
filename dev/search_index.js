This amounts to defining canonical isomorphisms between the different ways to order and partition the tensor indices. For example, a tensor map W  V can also be denoted as a rank 2 tensor in V  W^*, where W^* is the dual space of W. This simple example introduces two new concepts:","category":"page"},{"location":"Manual/introduction/","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Typical vector spaces can appear in the domain and codomain in different related forms.\nIn general, every vector space V has a dual space V^*, a conjugate space  overlineV, and a conjugate dual space overlineV^*.\nThe spaces V^* and overlineV correspond respectively to the  representation spaces of the dual and complex conjugate representation of the general  linear group mathsfGL(V).\nFor complex vector spaces with an inner product overlineV  V  ‚ÑÇ, the inner  product allows to define an isomorphism from the conjugate space to the dual space.\nIn spaces with a Euclidean inner product (the setting of quantum mechanics), the  conjugate and dual space are naturally isomorphic (because the dual and conjugate  representation of the unitary group are the same).\nIn cartesian space ‚Ñù^d with a Euclidean inner product, these four different spaces  are all equivalent. The space is completely characterized by its dimension d. This  is the setting of much of classical mechanics. The tensors in ‚Ñù^d can equally well  be represented as multidimensional arrays (i.e. using AbstractArray{<:Real,N} in  Julia) without loss of structure.\nIn general, the identification between maps W  V and tensors in  V  W^* is not an equivalence but an isomorphism, which needs to be defined.  Similarly, there is an isomorphism between between V  W and W  V that can be  non-trivial (e.g. in the case of fermions / super vector spaces). The correct formalism  here is provided by theory of monoidal categories.","category":"page"},{"location":"Manual/introduction/","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"This brings us to our final formal definition of a tensor map:","category":"page"},{"location":"Manual/introduction/","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"A tensor map is a homomorphism between two objects from the category mathbfVect   (or some subcategory thereof).
